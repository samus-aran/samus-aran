## About me

* Born in the USA
* Moved to Scotland aged 3. Been here ever since.
* During my younger years I was a competing [Highland dancer/teacher](https://www.sohda.co.uk/gallery), played Cello in the [National Youth Orchestras of Scotland](https://www.nyos.co.uk/) and wore braces.
* Mother to two rugrats
* Studied Internet Technologies @ Uni and started off as a software engineer.

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
I am an open book. I have always lived openly about my pains, joys and fears. This does mean I can come across as being TMI but I am respectful of peoples' view when this happens. :sweat_smile:

### When are you available?
* I'm mostly an afternoon person. My focus time is in the early morning.

### What drives you nuts?
* Insincerity

### What are your quirks?
* I love mindmaps. I'm very visual and often need to physically write something down and join my thoughts using lines and references. I have a white board in my room. I :heart: it.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* My TMI label. But I also ask alot of questions one after the other (my thought train). I often have to re-track the source of the thought so others can find it eaiser to answer.

## Who I love to work along side with.

I particularly love to work with people who are honest, open, collaborative and that they don't avoid and settle for status quo.
We should always praise sincerely whenever can and of course be accommodating to peoples' lives/schedule.

## Help & Feedback

* I love to help people by assisting them to achieve their goals. If I can make something eaiser for them to do or concentrate on a big task then I'll enable it if I can.
* I like writen notes if we were having a meeting (or a follow up) and if possible diagrams or visual aids to explain connections.
* If I must be persuaded then give me a better, more scalable solution that doesn't demean individuals.

### How do you like to give feedback?
* I am respectful that not everyone is as open as me so my approach differs for who I'm speaking to. But I try and be practical and give feedback directly with room for them to reflect on the feedback. People make mistakes, it's to be expected in fact, so we should focus on moving on and learn from them.

### How do you like to get feedback?
* I'm not super patient (I'm working on that) but so I prefer immediate and direct feedback with steps on how to progress.
